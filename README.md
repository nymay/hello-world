Testing things out.
**I'm tired and want to go to bed but I have so much to do.**

####What I need to do
* Pass my classes
* Make professional grade art
  * Have passion
  * Don't cry
* Work so I have money to live
  * **why does everything need money?!**
* Hopefully sleep
* Maybe get to be happy for a moment

Oh how I hope this semester ends well :weary:
